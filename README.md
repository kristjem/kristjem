### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

08.01.2024 - I'm currently enrolled in a one year Backend Development study program at Noroff - School of technology and digital media, which I will take over the course of two years, beside working. 

Work:|
I'm a self taught developer, primarily working with SQL and Python, on prem. I'm also a state authorized accountant, but in later years I've solely worked with IT, scripting and programming. Currently we're planning and working on moving several things from on prem to the cloud.

Skills:
- SQL
- Python
- Go (just started learning)
- Git
- Working with APIs, using Pythons Requests library
- Several norwegian accounting/ERP systems

Hobbies:
- Home automation (Home Assistant, Zigbee, MQTT, Node-RED, and more)
- Music, particulary synthesizers, sequencers, samplers and the piano
- Soldering, just started building a small modular synthesizer
- Mechanical work on cars and all sorts of tinkering in my garage
